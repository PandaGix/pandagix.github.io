## Attention!

This distro do contains non-free software but does NOT endorse any non-free software.
We believe non-free software is non-ethical, harmful to software development and restricts the users' freedom.
See the [GNU philosophy](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) for a more thorough discussion.

Those non-free softwares/packages are provided as a last resort, should none of the official Guix packages work for you.

You should understand the implication of using non-free software. Some of those implications include:
- Endorsement of non-free products and the perpetration of a culture of restriction on liberties.
- Non-free software cannot (or hardly) be audited: it can potentially spy on you, destroy or steal your data.

As a minimal security measure, runing non-free software inside a container is recommended.
